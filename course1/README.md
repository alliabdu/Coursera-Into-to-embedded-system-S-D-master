In this programming assignment, you will get more experience with Git Version control, write more C-programming code, and integrate your code with your build system. You will reuse your version control repository and add some new c-programming functions that manipulate memory. You will test your code on your host machine, but your code should compile for both the target platform and host platform.



 @Deal With The Program:

1- Build System Target on Host Machine: 

                                       $ make build PLATFORM=HOST COURSE=COURSE1 VERBOSE=VERBOSE
2- Run The Test Code: 


                                       $ ./course1.out
3- Build System Target For ARM: 


                                       $ make build PLATFORM=MSP432 COURSE=COURSE1 VERBOSE=VERBOSE
4- Delete All Created Files: 


                                       $ make clean
